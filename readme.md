# Original home tab

The only reason you will need this extension is if your organization has locked the new tab into a web page and you want Chrome's default page back.

After installing the extension, you will see Chrome's new tab page when you click the plus sign next to the last tab.
It is also possible to set Ctrl + T as the keyboard shortcut for the extension, so this will also work when you use the keyboard shortcut. The keyboard shortcut must be set in Chrome settings (chrome://extensions/shortcuts)


# Permissions 
"Tabs" - the extension needs this access to check when a new tab is opened, and to be able to override the web page set by the organization.
